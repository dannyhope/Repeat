Learn the web by spaced repetition

Helps you memorise web pages by showing you them again.

It schedules showing you the pages using an algorythm like SM2

The general principle is known as [spaced repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition "spaced repetition on Wikipedia")

When the user revisits a past page, they have a way of saying that they’ve learned this stuff.
